- 👋 Hi, I’m @pcevey
- 👀 I’m interested in astronomy and diy devices linked to it
- 🌱 I’m a retired person, after about 30 years in pharmaceutical industry, with biochemical engineering background
- 💞️ I use a self-configured raspberrypi to manage my astronomy telescope, mount and all devices and have very basic skills to use it with KStars/Ekos on Ubuntu
